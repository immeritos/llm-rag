Diagnosis is based on behavioural symptoms, using ICD-10 or DSM-5, both requiring symptoms across multiple settings and evident in early life (ICD-10: by age 7; DSM-5: by age 12). \n\nPrevalence: ICD-10 (hyperkinetic disorder) 1–2% in childhood; DSM-IV 3–9%; DSM-5 may increase rates. Causes are not fully understood; genetic factors are influential, and family history should be considered. \n\nFunctional impairment is required for diagnosis, with severity judged by impairment level, pervasiveness, and context. Impairments may vary from minimal in a few domains to significant across multiple domains. Symptoms can change over time, and may be improved by environmental modifications. \n\nDifferential diagnosis is important as symptoms overlap with other disorders. \n\nCoexisting conditions: \n- In children – mood, conduct, learning, motor control, language/communication, anxiety disorders. \n- In adults – personality disorders, bipolar disorder, OCD, substance misuse. \n\nUnder-recognition occurs in some populations, reducing quality of life. The guideline aims to raise awareness of at-risk populations and provide clear management advice, covering children under 5, children and young people (5–17), and adults (18+), across all NHS-funded primary, secondary, and community care settings.", "tags": ["context_background", "diagnosis", "comorbidities", "information_support"], "population": ["children_under_5", "children_5_and_over", "young_people", "adults", "carers"], "source": "NICE NG87", "dates": {"published": "2018-03-14", "last_updated": "2019-09-13"}, "retrievable": false, "bullets": ["nan"], "notes": ["nan"], "title": "Background and scope", "title_path": "Context", "section_id": "", "section_title": "Context", "source_id": "ng87-context-1"}
